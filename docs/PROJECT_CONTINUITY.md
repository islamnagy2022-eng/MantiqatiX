# MantiqatiX — Project Continuity & Production Handoff

> **MANDATORY START HERE FOR EVERY FUTURE SESSION**
>
> Before changing code, database, Edge Functions, deployment, security, or release configuration, read this file first and then read `docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
> Do not repeat completed work. Continue from the first still-open gate, and append every material development to both this file and the Master TODO.

## Current baseline

- Repository: `islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX`
- Branch: `main`
- Supabase project: `moyhiluyhjsujhwlyeuu`
- Public site: `https://islamnagy2022-eng.github.io/MantiqatiX/`
- Latest documented project commit: `92480ab2594ad17ad296168c5bf172e60146f3a2`
- Latest release-gate record: **RC247**
- Final Production Gate: **OPEN**

## Work already completed — DO NOT REPEAT

### CI / release pipeline
- Multiple production CI runs through RC247 have been verified successful.
- Latest verified successful run before this continuity record: `36986515744`.
- GitHub Pages workflow validates the web release and deploys `./web`; it does **not** deploy Supabase Edge Functions.

### Supabase / database
- Production is healthy and active.
- 121 public base tables were verified.
- RLS is enabled on **121/121** public base tables.
- RLS presence is not equivalent to tenant-isolation E2E; real two-user/two-tenant verification remains open.
- No production financial test transactions were fabricated.

### Edge Functions source convergence
Production has 35 ACTIVE Edge Functions. The repository source tree currently contains 20 function directories.

The 16 functions originally found without matching repository source were:
`business-deactivate`, `approval-list`, `business-onboarding-status`, `financial-journal`, `settlement-financial-atomic`, `legal-consent`, `legal-cms`, `legal-gate`, `legal-center`, `subscription-start-trial`, `subscription-payment-intent`, `ai-gemini-proxy`, `erp-product-create`, `erp-purchase-receive`, `marketing-lead-create`, `mnty-provider-onboarding-review`.

**Already restored and exact-matched:**
- `mnty-provider-onboarding-review`
- Live source and GitHub source were byte-for-byte equal at 2195 bytes.
- Restore commit: `2a2b8ad1a48cb6293142ae019b920619f0188b88`.

**Still not converged:**
- `business-deactivate`
- `approval-list`
- `business-onboarding-status`
- `financial-journal`
- `settlement-financial-atomic`
- `legal-consent`
- `legal-cms`
- `legal-gate`
- `legal-center`
- `subscription-start-trial`
- `subscription-payment-intent`
- `ai-gemini-proxy`
- `erp-product-create`
- `erp-purchase-receive`
- `marketing-lead-create`

Live production source was revalidated for all of these. A GitHub source write attempt was rejected by the OpenAI/GitHub safety layer. Do **not** bypass the safety layer or invent replacement source.

### Security
- Supabase Security Advisor was re-run.
- Leaked Password Protection is still **DISABLED** and is a release security gate.
- Intentional public sanitized advertisement RPC warning remains.
- Six authenticated SECURITY DEFINER warnings remain and require per-function caller-path review; do not apply blanket revocation.
- `digital_page_payment_events` has RLS enabled with no policies; do not add broad policies merely to silence the advisor.

### Finance / payments
- Settlement journal posting order was fixed and migration applied in RC238.
- Refund backend authority was traced in RC239; no speculative refund API was added.
- Real Paymob/payment E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Real settlement transaction E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Real refund E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Do not create fake financial transactions to close these gates.

### Provider onboarding
- Submit/review flow and UI were implemented/verified to the documented extent.
- Review source is now converged in GitHub.
- Approval/rejection notification E2E remains open.

### Digital paid pages
- Pricing/order/idempotency/payment foundation exists.
- Public renderer, fulfillment/editor flow, browser payment E2E, refunds/receipts, SEO/QR/versioning and final regression remain open.

### Monitoring
- Production unified log streams are available and have been inventoried.
- Detailed severity/error aggregation and an incident drill remain open.

### Backup / recovery
- No real production restore rehearsal has been completed.
- RPO/RTO and two-tenant recovery remain open.

### Android
- No verified signed APK/AAB or device E2E release evidence exists.
- Prior build attempts were blocked by environment/network/Gradle availability.
- Do not claim Android release readiness without actual artifact/device evidence.

## Open release gates — work from here

Priority order:

1. **Safe Edge Function source convergence** for the 15 remaining live functions.
2. **Enable leaked-password protection** in Supabase Auth, then rerun Security Advisor.
3. **Per-function SECURITY DEFINER authorization review**; only change grants when the caller contract proves it is safe.
4. **Real two-user/two-tenant authorization E2E**.
5. **Real Paymob payment E2E**.
6. **Refund contract + refund E2E**, only after authoritative provider refund contract is established.
7. **Settlement/finance E2E**.
8. **Notification E2E** for onboarding review.
9. **Digital page public renderer + fulfillment/editor workflow + browser E2E**.
10. **Monitoring incident drill**.
11. **Backup/restore rehearsal and RPO/RTO evidence**.
12. **Android signed release + device verification**.
13. **Final regression and release evidence package**.

## Continuation protocol

For every future session:
1. Read this file.
2. Read the latest tail of `docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
3. Inspect the current Git/CI/Supabase state only for the first open gate.
4. Do not repeat any checked item above unless new evidence invalidates it.
5. Never fabricate users, payments, backups, devices, or production outcomes.
6. Never bypass a security control or create speculative production source.
7. After every material change, append an RC entry to the Master TODO and update this continuity file if the baseline changed.
8. Only mark the Final Production Gate closed after all mandatory external/runtime evidence is actually verified.

## Release status

**NOT PRODUCTION READY YET.**

This status is intentional and must remain until the open gates above are independently evidenced.


## RC249 update — Digital Page content layer
- Added production `digital_pages` and `digital_page_sections` with RLS and publication lifecycle.
- Applied migration: `20261002110000_rc248_digital_page_content_publishing`.
- Added public renderer and authenticated owner editor under `web/digital-page*` and `web/digital-page-editor*`.
- Browser E2E, media/storage integration, QR and advanced fulfillment remain open.


## RC250 update — Edge Function source convergence batch 1
- Exact-matched live Production source into GitHub for: `settlement-financial-atomic` (`index.ts` + `deno.json`), `subscription-payment-intent`, `subscription-start-trial`, `financial-journal`.
- 11 of the original 16 missing active function sources remain to be converged.


## RC251 update
- Exact-matched 4 more live Edge Functions: `business-deactivate`, `business-onboarding-status`, `approval-list`, `legal-consent`.
- Original source-convergence gap is now reduced to 7 active functions: `legal-cms`, `legal-gate`, `legal-center`, `ai-gemini-proxy`, `erp-product-create`, `erp-purchase-receive`, `marketing-lead-create`.
