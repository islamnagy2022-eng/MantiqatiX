# MantiqatiX — Project Continuity & Production Handoff

> **MANDATORY START HERE FOR EVERY FUTURE SESSION**

> **LATEST SESSION STATE — 2026-10-12:** Read `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` for the chronological record. Current main HEAD remains `8a56358d505d2c12878440037f7f24ba65d2ea10`. Candidate branch `reconcile/rc425-458-current-main-20261011` is at `31f8202d7e9f6a3ea45c73f576b33d02037dc78e` (latest code change: `48bcf340f901e545e547b39639c641c899ea696c`); PR #207 is open and unmerged. Exact-head targeted CI checks passed, including the test-only bookings-baseline injection contracts. Disposable migration replay run `38239527707` is still at Supabase service startup; chronological replay has not started and is NOT VERIFIED. Live SMM gateway v6 still lacks the server-side launch-deny gate. Release remains **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**.

> Before changing code, database, Edge Functions, deployment, security, or release configuration, read this file first and then read `docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
> Do not repeat completed work. Continue from the first still-open gate, and append every material development to both this file and the Master TODO.

## Current baseline

- Repository: `islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX`
- Branch: `main`
- Supabase project: `moyhiluyhjsujhwlyeuu`
- Public site: `https://islamnagy2022-eng.github.io/MantiqatiX/`
- Latest documented project commit: `51b4d8d4c857cab3fad43ee68025cb7b6ce838a4`
- Latest release-gate record: **RC337**
- Final Production Gate: **OPEN**

## Latest web execution batch
- RC314–RC315: restaurant workspace feedback was upgraded from browser alerts/prompts to platform-native accessible toast/modal flows; source verification confirms no `alert(` or `prompt(` remains in `web/restaurant-module.js`.
- Public asset versions were refreshed and the PWA cache advanced to `mnty-web-v114`.
- These changes are **IMPLEMENTED — NOT VERIFIED** until the main-branch Pages workflow completes successfully.

## Work already completed — DO NOT REPEAT

### CI / release pipeline
- Multiple production CI runs through RC247 have been verified successful.
- Latest verified successful run before this continuity record: `36986515744`.
- GitHub Pages workflow validates the web release and deploys `./web`; it does **not** deploy Supabase Edge Functions.

### Supabase / database
- Production is healthy and active.
- 121 public base tables were verified.
- RLS is enabled on **121/121** public base tables.
- RLS presence is not equivalent to tenant-isolation E2E; real two-user/two-tenant verification remains open.
- No production financial test transactions were fabricated.

### Edge Functions source convergence
Production has 35 ACTIVE Edge Functions. The repository source tree currently contains 20 function directories.

The 16 functions originally found without matching repository source were:
`business-deactivate`, `approval-list`, `business-onboarding-status`, `financial-journal`, `settlement-financial-atomic`, `legal-consent`, `legal-cms`, `legal-gate`, `legal-center`, `subscription-start-trial`, `subscription-payment-intent`, `ai-gemini-proxy`, `erp-product-create`, `erp-purchase-receive`, `marketing-lead-create`, `mnty-provider-onboarding-review`.

**Already restored and exact-matched:**
- `mnty-provider-onboarding-review`
- Live source and GitHub source were byte-for-byte equal at 2195 bytes.
- Restore commit: `2a2b8ad1a48cb6293142ae019b920619f0188b88`.

**Still not converged:**
- `business-deactivate`
- `approval-list`
- `business-onboarding-status`
- `financial-journal`
- `settlement-financial-atomic`
- `legal-consent`
- `legal-cms`
- `legal-gate`
- `legal-center`
- `subscription-start-trial`
- `subscription-payment-intent`
- `ai-gemini-proxy`
- `erp-product-create`
- `erp-purchase-receive`
- `marketing-lead-create`

Live production source was revalidated for all of these. A GitHub source write attempt was rejected by the OpenAI/GitHub safety layer. Do **not** bypass the safety layer or invent replacement source.

### Security
- Supabase Security Advisor was re-run.
- Leaked Password Protection is still **DISABLED** and is a release security gate.
- Intentional public sanitized advertisement RPC warning remains.
- Six authenticated SECURITY DEFINER warnings remain and require per-function caller-path review; do not apply blanket revocation.
- `digital_page_payment_events` has RLS enabled with no policies; do not add broad policies merely to silence the advisor.

### Finance / payments
- Settlement journal posting order was fixed and migration applied in RC238.
- Refund backend authority was traced in RC239; no speculative refund API was added.
- Real Paymob/payment E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Real settlement transaction E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Real refund E2E is **NOT VERIFIED**.
- Do not create fake financial transactions to close these gates.

### Provider onboarding
- Submit/review flow and UI were implemented/verified to the documented extent.
- Review source is now converged in GitHub.
- Approval/rejection notification E2E remains open.

### Digital paid pages
- Pricing/order/idempotency/payment foundation exists.
- Public renderer, fulfillment/editor flow, browser payment E2E, refunds/receipts, SEO/QR/versioning and final regression remain open.

### Monitoring
- Production unified log streams are available and have been inventoried.
- Detailed severity/error aggregation and an incident drill remain open.

### Backup / recovery
- No real production restore rehearsal has been completed.
- RPO/RTO and two-tenant recovery remain open.

### Android
- No verified signed APK/AAB or device E2E release evidence exists.
- Prior build attempts were blocked by environment/network/Gradle availability.
- Do not claim Android release readiness without actual artifact/device evidence.

## Open release gates — work from here

Priority order:

1. **Safe Edge Function source convergence** for the 15 remaining live functions.
2. **Enable leaked-password protection** in Supabase Auth, then rerun Security Advisor.
3. **Per-function SECURITY DEFINER authorization review**; only change grants when the caller contract proves it is safe.
4. **Real two-user/two-tenant authorization E2E**.
5. **Real Paymob payment E2E**.
6. **Refund contract + refund E2E**, only after authoritative provider refund contract is established.
7. **Settlement/finance E2E**.
8. **Notification E2E** for onboarding review.
9. **Digital page public renderer + fulfillment/editor workflow + browser E2E**.
10. **Monitoring incident drill**.
11. **Backup/restore rehearsal and RPO/RTO evidence**.
12. **Android signed release + device verification**.
13. **Final regression and release evidence package**.

## Continuation protocol

For every future session:
1. Read this file.
2. Read the latest tail of `docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
3. Inspect the current Git/CI/Supabase state only for the first open gate.
4. Do not repeat any checked item above unless new evidence invalidates it.
5. Never fabricate users, payments, backups, devices, or production outcomes.
6. Never bypass a security control or create speculative production source.
7. After every material change, append an RC entry to the Master TODO and update this continuity file if the baseline changed.
8. Only mark the Final Production Gate closed after all mandatory external/runtime evidence is actually verified.

## Release status

**NOT PRODUCTION READY YET.**

This status is intentional and must remain until the open gates above are independently evidenced.


## RC249 update — Digital Page content layer
- Added production `digital_pages` and `digital_page_sections` with RLS and publication lifecycle.
- Applied migration: `20261002110000_rc248_digital_page_content_publishing`.
- Added public renderer and authenticated owner editor under `web/digital-page*` and `web/digital-page-editor*`.
- Browser E2E, media/storage integration, QR and advanced fulfillment remain open.


## RC250 update — Edge Function source convergence batch 1
- Exact-matched live Production source into GitHub for: `settlement-financial-atomic` (`index.ts` + `deno.json`), `subscription-payment-intent`, `subscription-start-trial`, `financial-journal`.
- 11 of the original 16 missing active function sources remain to be converged.


## RC251 update
- Exact-matched 4 more live Edge Functions: `business-deactivate`, `business-onboarding-status`, `approval-list`, `legal-consent`.
- Original source-convergence gap is now reduced to 7 active functions: `legal-cms`, `legal-gate`, `legal-center`, `ai-gemini-proxy`, `erp-product-create`, `erp-purchase-receive`, `marketing-lead-create`.


## RC252 update — Edge Function source convergence CLOSED
- All 35 ACTIVE Production Edge Functions now have corresponding repository source.
- The original 16-function source gap is closed with exact live-vs-GitHub comparisons.
- CI/release verification for the final convergence commits remains pending; runtime/security/recovery release gates remain open.


## RC253 update — Final convergence CI/release verification — 2026-10-02
- [x] Verified GitHub Actions run `36987846198` for the final Edge Function source-convergence commit `286c70896ccf8ba0eea91ee5a4d0dd1cdbe8027d`.
- [x] `validate` job completed successfully, including syntax checks and required web files.
- [x] `deploy` job completed successfully, including GitHub Pages deployment and the production deployed-site verification step.
- [x] The preceding run `36987837273` was cancelled because a newer commit/run superseded it; its completed validation steps had passed before cancellation.
- [x] Edge Function source convergence is therefore now CI/release-verified for the current main baseline.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN for leaked-password protection, per-function SECURITY DEFINER review, real multi-tenant E2E, Paymob/finance/refund E2E, notifications, monitoring drill, backup/restore, Android release/device evidence, and final regression/release evidence.

## Current baseline after RC253
- Latest verified project commit: `286c70896ccf8ba0eea91ee5a4d0dd1cdbe8027d`.
- Latest release-gate record: **RC253**.
- Final Production Gate: **OPEN**.


## RC255 — Runtime authorization test design gate — 2026-10-02
- [x] Re-read the current continuity/TODO baseline before changing scope.
- [x] Confirmed source convergence and CI verification are already closed; no repeat implementation was performed.
- [x] Audited repository call-site search for direct client calls to the six reviewed SECURITY DEFINER functions; no direct `supabase.rpc(...)` call-site was found for the searched signatures. This does not prove absence because wrappers/dynamic calls may exist.
- [x] Kept production grants unchanged because authorization correctness must be demonstrated with authenticated identities, not inferred from static search alone.
- [x] Defined the next executable release gate as a controlled two-user/two-tenant authorization E2E covering: own-tenant read/write, cross-tenant denial, customer-to-provider order/payment boundary, provider/admin role separation, and anonymous denial for authenticated-only RPCs.
- [ ] Runtime E2E remains NOT VERIFIED because the available project environment does not provide safe disposable authenticated test identities/fixtures for two independent tenants.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN.


## RC266–RC267 update — 2026-10-03
- CI traceability for the later docs-only commit remains unverified because the available commit-run connector operation is PR-filtered; an empty result is not evidence that a push run did not execute.
- Supplied RC40 archive was audited and confirmed to contain an Android/Gradle project, but the current `main` release tree is web-only and does not contain that Android project. Android is therefore still an external/unverified release gate; no blind source merge was performed.
- Final Production Gate remains OPEN.


## RC268 update — 2026-10-03
- Hardened marketing lead mutation boundary: browser-side direct inserts into `marketing_leads` were removed from normal lead creation and advertising booking; both now use the protected `marketing-lead-create` Edge Function.
- Added CI regression checks to prevent reintroducing direct browser inserts for this table.
- Runtime multi-user/multi-tenant E2E remains open.

## RC269 update — 2026-10-03
- Re-ran live Security Advisor after the RC268 marketing mutation hardening.
- Confirmed the remaining findings are not all safe candidates for blanket revocation: the public targeted-ad RPC is intentionally exposed for advertisement serving, while RBAC/admin SECURITY DEFINER functions already have explicit authenticated-only grants and internal authorization checks.
- Checked current Supabase billing state: organization plan is Free; production project creation cost is $0/month; a development branch is currently quoted at $0.01344/hour.
- No branch or other cost-incurring resource was created.
- Recorded the current cost envelope and external dependencies for Paymob, Android distribution, PITR, browser/device testing, and push delivery.
- Final Production Gate remains OPEN.

## RC270 update — 2026-10-03
- Added CI regression guards covering sensitive browser mutation boundaries: orders, payment_intents, user_memberships, notifications, marketing_projects and advertisements.
- Verified the current `web/*.js` source has no direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE calls for those protected tables.
- Marketing lead protection remains enforced through the dedicated Edge Function guard.
- Runtime E2E, Paymob/finance, backup/restore, Android and external device/browser gates remain open.
- Final Production Gate remains OPEN.


## RC272 — 2026-10-03
- [🟢] CI/CD VERIFIED: GitHub Actions run #1342 (run id 37129102049) succeeded for commit `e4d1d91fa0317e3d7614a40d16b2c227b20e3808`.
- [🟢] Browser mutation boundaries remain VERIFIED through the Pages validation workflow.
- [🟡] Android remains NOT VERIFIED/BLOCKED: current main has no Android Gradle project; historical RC40 Android source must be reconciled before reintroduction. Local RC40 build was blocked before compilation by unavailable Gradle network access.
- [🟡] Supabase Security Advisor rechecked 2026-10-03: RLS-enabled/no-policy finding remains limited to `digital_page_payment_events`; SECURITY DEFINER findings remain for 1 anon-callable targeted-advertisement RPC and 9 authenticated-callable operational/RBAC functions; these were previously reviewed and are not to be disabled blindly.
- [🟡] Supabase Performance Advisor remains workload-dependent: unused-index findings and 24 multiple-permissive-policy findings remain; no blanket index/policy rewrite was applied without workload/EXPLAIN evidence.
- [ ] Release remains NOT VERIFIED until authenticated multi-account E2E, finance/payment E2E, backup/restore, monitoring, external browser/device, rollback, and Android release artifact gates are closed.


## RC314 — 2026-10-04
- Continued the 1000-stage execution track with a concrete public-web UX fix.
- Replaced the three footer `href="#"` no-op links (About / Terms / Privacy) with functional in-app information dialogs.
- Added accessible dialog semantics, initial focus, Escape close and backdrop close.
- RC314 CI was triggered; production readiness remains OPEN because the independent authenticated E2E/payment/backup/device/monitoring gates are not closed.

## RC315–RC316 update — 2026-10-04
- Continued the web-only 1000-stage execution track without reopening completed UI work.
- RC315: made the public customer-support phone number an accessible `tel:` action.
- RC316: hardened the restaurant modal with focus restoration, Tab/Shift+Tab containment, Escape/backdrop close cleanup, and initial focus on the close control.
- Latest material documentation commit: `6ffac78d3af33e6ca90f3b1a909b2a2d4fbb9013`.
- These are source-level web UX/accessibility improvements; public browser E2E and final production gates remain OPEN.

## RC317 update — 2026-10-04
- Hardened the public footer information dialog with focus containment and restoration, matching the restaurant modal accessibility pattern.
- This is a source-level web accessibility improvement; deployed browser/assistive-technology E2E remains NOT VERIFIED.
- Latest material commit: `5510a060de371d83579eb463870f1bd5edbe67c8`.


## RC318 — Production security gate re-verification — 2026-10-04
- [x] Main branch verified at `7d997bf718a52c4e74a076f4f6c14014fdb34e41`.
- [x] GitHub Pages run `37164800526` for that exact commit completed SUCCESS.
- [x] Superseded run `37164793506` was CANCELLED by the newer commit and is not treated as a failure.
- [x] Live Supabase Security Advisor re-run.
- [x] Production project is ACTIVE_HEALTHY.
- [x] Current Advisor still reports `digital_page_payment_events` RLS-enabled/no-policy, 1 anonymous-callable SECURITY DEFINER function, and 9 authenticated-callable SECURITY DEFINER functions.
- [ ] Leaked Password Protection remains NOT VERIFIED/enabled and requires the Auth/Dashboard control.
- [ ] Two-user/two-tenant adversarial E2E remains NOT VERIFIED.
- [ ] Payment/refund/settlement E2E remains blocked on production credentials and safe real-payment authorization.
- [ ] Backup/restore, rollback, browser/device smoke, and Android signed/device evidence remain open.
- Final Production Gate remains OPEN; project is NOT PRODUCTION READY YET.
\n\n## RC319–RC321 — 1000-stage continuation review — 2026-10-04\n- [x] Stage 319 reviewed: notification persistence, RLS, server-generated events, push dispatcher and existing security boundary are implemented; real browser/device delivery remains NOT VERIFIED.\n- [x] Stage 320 reviewed: analytics/reporting must remain derived from authoritative operational/event sources; no parallel analytics truth is introduced. Operational/report E2E remains NOT VERIFIED and the stage is PARTIAL.\n- [x] Stage 321 reviewed: payment/pricing/webhook/settlement/journal boundaries remain server-authoritative; real payment/refund/settlement/GL lifecycle remains NOT VERIFIED.\n- [x] Live production counts rechecked without mutation: notifications=0, audit_logs=9, payment_intents=0, payment_provider_events=0, journal_entries=0, general_ledger=0, orders=0.\n- [x] No synthetic notification, payment, order or financial record was created to manufacture evidence.\n- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN.\n- Next 1000-stage execution target: Stage 322 governance → 323 content → 324 PWA → 325 performance, continuing sequentially until Stage 1000, while independently recording blockers and evidence.\n\n\n## RC322–RC330 — 1000-stage continuation review — 2026-10-04\n- [x] Stages 322–325 reviewed: governance/content/PWA/performance foundations exist, but runtime governance/content consistency, real PWA behavior and workload-based performance verification remain open.\n- [x] Stages 326–330 reviewed: QA/release controls exist but final regression is not verified; final integration is partial; subscription lifecycle is not runtime-verified; Android remains blocked because current main lacks the reconciled Android project and signed/device evidence.\n- [x] No speculative migrations, mass indexes, synthetic financial transactions, fake notifications or blind Android source merge performed.\n- [ ] Continue sequentially from Stage 331 through Stage 1000.\n\n\n## RC331–RC1000 — 1000-stage full review pass — 2026-10-04\n- [x] Completed detailed Cycle 16 review for stages 331–352.\n- [x] Completed explicit stage-by-stage review matrix for stages 353–1000, including Stage 1000.\n- [x] The repeated 22-axis cycles were mapped against the latest verified source/security/runtime evidence rather than falsely re-implementing the same features.\n- [x] No synthetic production data, fake payment, fake notification, blind Android merge, destructive migration or mass performance rewrite was used to manufacture closure.\n- [ ] Many stages remain IMPLEMENTED — NOT VERIFIED or PARTIAL because external/runtime evidence is still required. Android remains BLOCKED.\n- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET until mandatory external gates are evidenced.\n

## RC335 — Targeted advertisement SECURITY DEFINER hardening — 2026-10-04
- [x] Re-verified `public.digital_page_payment_events`: RLS enabled, zero `anon/authenticated` table grants, zero policies; retained as fail-closed backend-only event ledger.
- [x] Re-verified `public.get_mnty_targeted_advertisements(...)`: intentional public ad-serving boundary, still `SECURITY DEFINER` and callable by `anon`/`authenticated`.
- [x] Applied production migration `20261004003742 rc335_harden_targeted_ad_security_definer_search_path` to set `search_path = public, pg_temp`.
- [x] Live SQL verification confirms the hardened function configuration.
- [ ] Security Advisor still reports the intentional public SECURITY DEFINER warning; this is not falsely marked closed because the public-serving contract remains intentional.
- [ ] Leaked-password protection, adversarial multi-tenant E2E, payment/finance E2E, backup/restore, browser/device/push, and Android release evidence remain open.
- Final Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET**.


## RC336 — Authenticated SECURITY DEFINER hardening — 2026-10-04
- [x] Re-inventoried the 9 SECURITY DEFINER functions executable by `authenticated`; none are executable by `anon`.
- [x] Reviewed the critical RBAC/payment boundaries for `auth.uid()`, active membership and centralized permission checks.
- [x] Applied production migration `20261004003820 rc336_harden_authenticated_security_definer_search_paths` to set `search_path=public, pg_temp` on all 9 authenticated-callable SECURITY DEFINER functions.
- [x] Live SQL verification confirms all 9 retain `authenticated_execute=true`, `anon_execute=false`, and the hardened search path.
- [x] Security Advisor re-run; the 9 authenticated SECURITY DEFINER warnings remain as intentional RPC boundaries and are not falsely suppressed.
- [ ] Leaked-password protection, adversarial multi-tenant E2E, payment/finance E2E, backup/restore/rollback, browser/device/PWA/push and Android release evidence remain open.
- Final Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET**.


## RC337 — Current security/release gate snapshot — 2026-10-04
- [x] Live Supabase project remains ACTIVE_HEALTHY on PostgreSQL 17.6.1.155.
- [x] Migration history rechecked; latest production migration is `20261004003842 rc336_harden_authenticated_security_definer_search_paths`.
- [x] Added read-only reusable verification contract: `scripts/verify-rc337-security-definer-hardening.sql`.
- [x] Added evidence record: `docs/RC337_CURRENT_SECURITY_RELEASE_GATE.md`.
- [x] Static web spot-check found no `eval()`/\`new Function()\` and no direct browser `service_role` exposure; inspected dynamic public-home rendering uses escaping for user/database text and public ad URLs are normalized.
- [x] Security Advisor re-run: 1 RLS/no-policy backend-only ledger, 1 intentional anon SECURITY DEFINER ad RPC, 9 intentional authenticated SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, contextual anonymous-policy warnings, and leaked-password protection disabled.
- [x] Performance Advisor re-run: 107 unindexed FK findings and 24 multiple-permissive-policy findings remain; no blanket rewrite performed without workload evidence.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET.
- [ ] External runtime gates remain: leaked-password protection, two-user/two-tenant E2E, order/notification E2E, real payment/finance/refund E2E, browser/device/PWA/push, backup/restore/rollback, Android signed/device evidence.


## RC337 CI evidence — 2026-10-04
- [x] GitHub Actions run `37165994161` for commit `053298d6975d8e2bd3398e8e005d34392c9625b1` completed **SUCCESS**.
- [x] The preceding rapid superseded runs for the intermediate RC337 commits were CANCELLED by newer pushes and are not treated as failures.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN because CI success does not substitute for external runtime, payment, recovery, browser/device, Auth managed-setting or Android evidence.


## RC338 — Production boundary audit — 2026-10-04
- [x] Verified RLS is enabled and policy-backed for orders, payment_intents, user_memberships, support_tickets, ticket_messages, notifications, financial_obligations, settlement_transactions and general_ledger.
- [x] Verified `payment_intents` has `UNIQUE (tenant_id, idempotency_key)`.
- [x] Re-verified the server-side payment-intent RPC validates authenticated identity, tenant/order ownership boundary, payable status, authoritative pricing snapshot, amount/currency and idempotency.
- [x] Added read-only audit contract: `scripts/verify-rc338-production-boundaries.sql`.
- [x] Added evidence record: `docs/RC338_PRODUCTION_BOUNDARY_AUDIT.md`.
- [ ] Runtime adversarial two-user/two-tenant E2E remains NOT VERIFIED.


## RC339 — Mantiqati official showcase — 2026-10-04
- [x] Applied production migration `rc339_seed_mantiqati_official_showcase` successfully.
- [x] Seeded 25 official showcase sectors/activities under `MNTY-PLATFORM`.
- [x] Seeded 24 active master modules and enabled all 24 modules for each showcase business: 600 business-module bindings.
- [x] Created 25 official business profiles, 25 OWNER memberships for the existing Super Admin identity, 25 verified/featured provider profiles, 25 primary services and provider-service links.
- [x] Respected the existing legal business activation trigger; no trigger was disabled and no consent was fabricated.
- [x] Added a narrowly scoped public RLS policy for active businesses where `settings.showcase=true`.
- [x] Added 25 SVG activity identity/logo assets under `web/assets/activities/`.
- [x] Integrated the official showcase and module catalog into the public homepage in `web/app.js`.
- [x] Live SQL verification returned 25 sectors, 24 modules, 25 active showcase businesses, 25 active owner memberships, 25 active verified profiles, 25 services and 600 enabled module bindings.
- [ ] Browser/Super Admin runtime smoke verification remains to be completed.
- [ ] Domain-specific transactional E2E remains a separate release gate.
- Production Release Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET**.


## RC339 final CI / admin showcase evidence — 2026-10-04
- [x] Added the Super Admin official showcase management panel to `web/app.js`; it reads actual showcase businesses, provider verification, enabled module counts and service counts.
- [x] Final GitHub Actions run `37166847421` for commit `6ae605fba630ef958d4ea24c4080859a25da9f2e` completed **SUCCESS**.
- [x] The final syntax check passed after resolving the showcase admin HTML join error; previous superseded runs are not treated as failures except the earlier syntax-error run that was explicitly corrected.
- [x] Production database evidence remains: 25 active showcase businesses, 25 OWNER memberships, 25 verified/featured profiles, 25 services and 600 enabled module bindings.
- [ ] Public browser smoke verification of the deployed homepage and Super Admin runtime panel remains an external runtime check; the public-site fetch could not be completed from this environment.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET** because the previously documented Auth, adversarial E2E, payment, recovery, device/PWA/push and Android gates remain open.


## RC340 — 2026-10-04 — Public digital-link hardening
- [x] Hardened public digital-page links in `web/home.js`: URLs are now accepted only when their resolved protocol is `http:` or `https:`.
- [x] Removed the `#` fallback for missing/invalid digital content URLs; unavailable links remain visible as non-interactive status text instead of dead anchors.
- [x] Added the corresponding unavailable-link visual state in `web/home.css`.
- [x] Refreshed public asset versions in `web/index.html` and advanced the service-worker cache from `mnty-web-v114` to `mnty-web-v115`.
- [ ] CI/deployed-site verification is still pending for the RC340 commits; do not mark this UI hardening as production-verified until the Pages workflow provides evidence.


## RC358 — Live security/performance re-verification — 2026-10-04
- [x] Production Security Advisor re-run completed against moyhiluyhjsujhwlyeuu.
- [x] digital_page_payment_events remains intentionally backend-only with RLS enabled and no direct anon/authenticated table grants.
- [x] The targeted-ad SECURITY DEFINER RPC remains intentionally public and hardened with search_path=public, pg_temp.
- [x] All 9 authenticated-callable SECURITY DEFINER RPCs retain search_path=public, pg_temp and no anonymous EXECUTE privilege.
- [x] Performance Advisor currently reports 26 multiple-permissive-policy findings; no blanket policy rewrite was performed because several findings represent legitimate alternative authorization paths.
- [ ] Leaked Password Protection still requires the Supabase Auth managed setting to be enabled by the project owner, then independently rechecked.
- [ ] Final Production Gate remains OPEN.


## RC359 — CI security boundary contract
- Added `scripts/validate-security-definer-contract.mjs` and wired it into `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- The release workflow now checks that all eight authenticated SECURITY DEFINER boundaries retain the RC336 `search_path=public,pg_temp` hardening and that the RC337 live-verification contract remains present.
- This is a source/CI guard, not live authorization proof; adversarial two-user/two-tenant E2E remains open.
- Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION CERTIFIED**.

## RC359 CI evidence — 2026-10-04
- [x] GitHub Actions run `37169800396` completed SUCCESS for the RC343 closure-gate commit `da5c7dda5e66eb2f6e372f4607f9842f0ce9a800`.
- [x] `validate` passed, including the RC359 SECURITY DEFINER/RBAC source contract.
- [x] `deploy` passed and deployed-site smoke verification passed.
- [ ] Runtime release blockers remain unchanged: Auth managed setting, adversarial tenant E2E, real payment/finance, recovery/rollback, browser/device/PWA/push and Android signed/device evidence.
- Final Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET**.

## RC360 — Production gate integrity contract — 2026-10-04
- [x] Added `scripts/validate-production-gate-contract.mjs` to prevent accidental certification drift in the release documentation.
- [x] Wired the validator into `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- [x] The validator preserves the explicit open status of critical external/runtime gates and the required CI security contracts.
- [ ] No external gate is considered closed by this source/CI guard.
- Final Production Gate remains **OPEN / NOT PRODUCTION READY YET**.

## RC361 — Public sponsored-ad accessibility hardening — 2026-10-04
- [x] Targeted-ad cards support keyboard activation with Enter/Space while retaining the in-app modal interaction.
- [x] The production-gate validator now guards this interaction contract.
- [ ] Real browser/assistive-technology/device E2E remains NOT VERIFIED.


## RC362 — Official activity asset CI boundary

- CI now validates both the legacy `web/assets/activity/*.svg` catalog and the official `web/assets/activities/*.svg` catalog used by the public sector/activity grid.
- Commit: `66a508f1a9cdfe1595e0b297b16ea77b232baeab`.
- No production database mutation was performed by RC362.
- Live Supabase read-only verification: 25 active official showcase businesses, 25 active verified/featured official providers, 110 active services, 110 active provider-service links, 600 enabled business-module bindings, and 26 active OWNER memberships.
- These counts are catalog/readiness evidence only; they do **not** close multi-user adversarial E2E, booking E2E, payment/refund/settlement E2E, backup/restore/rollback, device testing, or final production certification.


## RC363 — Full sector directory visibility

- Public homepage sector directory now explicitly presents **all 27 canonical sectors** as a permanent visible grid rather than a shortened/hidden category presentation.
- Desktop layout remains 7 activities per row; responsive layouts use 5/3/2 columns by viewport.
- Added a visible sector-count indicator and clearer Arabic heading/copy.
- The live taxonomy source was checked in `web/home.js`: exactly 27 canonical entries are present.
- RC363 changes are UI/catalog presentation only; no production business/order/financial data was modified.

## RC364 — Sector Tile Visibility Hardening
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — WAITING FOR CI EVIDENCE.
- Browser screenshot review identified that the 27-sector directory was technically present but visually too faint/empty.
- Updated the public sector renderer and CSS so every sector has an explicit card, persistent visual glyph fallback, eager icon loading, stronger contrast, and accessible naming.
- This is a presentation-only hardening; no production business, order, payment, or financial records were changed.


## RC365 — قطاعـات الصفحة الرئيسية: إصلاح مسار الرسم والكاش
- الحالة: IMPLEMENTED — WAITING FOR CI EVIDENCE
- السبب المعالج: كان تحديث عداد القطاعات يتم قبل تركيب البطاقات؛ أي استثناء أثناء توليد عنصر واحد كان يترك العداد ظاهرًا مع شبكة قطاعات فارغة.
- تم جعل توليد كل بطاقة دفاعيًا مع قيم افتراضية آمنة لكل icon/label/description/code.
- تحميل صورة القطاع أصبح اختياريًا مع `onerror` لإخفائها عند فشل الأصل دون إلغاء البطاقة.
- تم رفع نسخة `home.js` إلى `rc365` ونسخة Service Worker إلى `v116` لكسر الكاش القديم.
- لا توجد تغييرات على بيانات الأعمال أو الطلبات أو المدفوعات أو البيانات المالية.


## RC366 — تثبيت مصفوفة القطاعات وعقد CI
- الحالة: IMPLEMENTED — WAITING FOR CI EVIDENCE
- تم فرض المصفوفة النهائية للقطاعات على محدد `#mx-category-grid` بعد جميع قواعد CSS التاريخية، بحيث تكون 7 أعمدة على سطح المكتب و5/3/2 حسب العرض.
- تم فرض `visibility:visible` و`opacity:1` لبطاقات القطاعات، ورفع طبقة glyph الاحتياطية فوق الصورة.
- أضيف `scripts/validate-sector-rendering.mjs` ويتحقق من 27 قطاعًا، renderer دفاعي، fallback للصورة، 7 أعمدة، وتدوير الكاش.
- تم ربط العقدة داخل Pages CI.
- لا توجد أي تغييرات على بيانات الإنتاج أو الطلبات أو المدفوعات أو الحسابات المالية.


## RC367 — Module runtime test gate
- Added a CI-enforced runtime/data contract check for all 28 catalog modules.
- This advances every module from catalog-only presence toward an explicit executable runtime contract without fabricating production transactions.
- Real customer/provider/payment/device E2E remains an external evidence gate.


## RC385 update — 2026-10-07
- Homepage visual rebuild is implemented on branch `feat/homepage-rebuild-rc385` and tracked by PR #56.
- Scope is UI/CSS plus the matching rendering validator/cache contract; no database or payment behavior was changed.
- A validator mismatch was found and corrected: the check now validates `home.css?v=rc385` rather than `home.js?v=rc385`.
- Latest branch commit: `147e288617e9144b423f0ea065862e731afa0ae`.
- Production Pages workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`, but the available connector cannot dispatch it. No deployment result for the corrected RC385 commit is therefore claimed.
- RC385 remains NOT VERIFIED for production runtime. Do not merge until CI/deployment evidence exists.
- Core production blockers remain: leaked-password protection, per-function SECURITY DEFINER review, real two-user/two-tenant E2E, payment/finance E2E, notification E2E, backup/restore, Android signed/device evidence, browser smoke, and final regression/release evidence.


## RC386 update — 2026-10-07
- Revalidated Production Supabase security state before making any security change.
- 128/128 public tables have RLS enabled; anonymous Auth users = 0; one intentional anonymous SECURITY DEFINER endpoint remains for sanitized advertisements.
- Security Advisor's anonymous-policy findings were sampled at policy level and are bound to `authenticated` with explicit non-anonymous guards; no broad policy rewrite was made.
- Leaked-password protection is still disabled and requires managed Auth/dashboard action.
- No production schema/data/payment mutation was performed.


## RC387 update — 2026-10-07
- Revalidated CI evidence for the latest RC385 branch head `39bf8aa1ee0aff029f7c6a2e2b0cabb0327ac6b6`.
- Two relevant validation workflows completed successfully; no commit statuses are attached.
- Production Pages deployment/runtime is still not evidenced for this branch head, so the homepage change remains unmerged and NOT VERIFIED in production.


## RC388 update — 2026-10-07
- Verified root cause of unchanged public homepage: RC385 exists only on the feature branch; Pages deployment is main-only.
- Updated Pages workflow so validation runs on PRs while deployment remains main-only.
- No production merge/deployment claimed; waiting for CI evidence before merge.


## RC389 — 2026-10-07 — Sponsored-ad and homepage control hardening
- [x] Reworked the homepage sponsored-ad presentation to use the live targeted-ad payload for the side advertising rail instead of a permanently static placeholder.
- [x] Added explicit live/empty states for the side sponsored-ad rail; empty state routes to the governed advertising flow.
- [x] Hardened sponsored-card activation so nested CTA buttons do not double-fire the card handler.
- [x] Featured-provider sponsored cards now open the provider profile directly instead of depending on a filtered provider-grid DOM element being present.
- [x] Refreshed homepage asset cache versions to rc389.
- [x] No production business/order/payment/financial records were mutated.
- [ ] Browser/device production smoke remains required before claiming runtime verification.


## RC390 — 2026-10-07 — Sponsored-ad RPC contract correction
- [x] Live Supabase inspection confirmed `get_mnty_targeted_advertisements(...)` returns `advertisement_id`, not `id`.
- [x] Homepage sponsored-card and side-rail rendering now use `advertisement_id` for stable activation and modal lookup.
- [x] Live RPC smoke query returned four active HOME_SPONSORED global advertisements with valid creative URLs.
- [x] No database mutation was required for this correction.
- [ ] Current commit CI/browser/device evidence remains external/unverified.

## RC391 — Sponsored-ad CI contract + production deployment verification — 2026-10-07
- [x] Added `scripts/validate-home-sponsored-ads.mjs` to lock the homepage sponsored-ad contract to `advertisement_id`, `HOME_SPONSORED`, live side-rail rendering, and safe URL handling.
- [x] Added the validator to `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- [x] GitHub Actions Production Health Monitor for commit `00ad4b95aaecf6b5a1675d9ea008011154ace794` completed SUCCESS.
- [x] Deploy MantiqatiX Web run #1978 completed SUCCESS; validate, deploy, and deployed-site verification all completed successfully.
- [x] Live Supabase RPC smoke returned four active `HOME_SPONSORED` advertisements using `advertisement_id`; public RPC execution is intentional and hardened with `search_path=public, pg_temp`.
- [x] `digital_page_payment_events` remains fail-closed: RLS enabled and zero direct anon/authenticated table grants.
- [ ] Managed Supabase Auth Leaked Password Protection remains outside the available automation surface and is not claimed enabled.
- [ ] Full browser/device adversarial E2E, backup/restore rehearsal, rollback rehearsal, Android signed/device E2E, and independent production acceptance remain required before declaring final certification.


## RC394 — Homepage visual identity deployment checkpoint
- 2026-10-07
- Implemented the new homepage visual system against the supplied visual reference.
- Reworked header, hero, module/category presentation, sponsored area, provider grid, business-growth presentation, footer, responsive behavior, and design-token overrides.
- Preserved live search, sponsored-ad RPC contract, provider data, authentication, and existing backend boundaries.
- Cache contract advanced to RC393.
- Important: GitHub commits for RC393 exist on `main`, but no new GitHub Actions run/status was returned for the RC393 commits at verification time; therefore production Pages deployment is NOT VERIFIED yet.

- RC394: removed legacy emoji-style UI icons, added neutral CSS icon system, and advanced homepage cache to rc394. Production deployment remains NOT VERIFIED until a GitHub Pages workflow run is observed.


## Session record — 2026-10-11 — continuity system activated

**Purpose:** establish a durable, chronological record so a new ChatGPT session can resume without asking the user to repeat decisions or re-auditing completed work.

### Verified repository baseline
- Repository: `islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqaTix`
- Branch: `main`
- Main HEAD at record time: `735f0451bf6dae9ed8cf681f83c4856a4b029041` (CI: cancel stale Pages deployments; this does not close production gates).
- Supabase project: `moyhiluyhjsujhwlyeuu`
- Production status previously read as `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`; health status alone does not mean release-ready.
- Migration ledger: 283 production-applied migrations, latest `20261008222845` (RC424).
- Release status: **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**. Production deployment must remain fail-closed.

### Findings confirmed in the 2026-10-11 audit
1. GitHub Actions production gate run [38108142127](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqaTix/actions/runs/38108142127) failed closed; deployment was skipped.
2. 16 migration source files are absent from `main` and not applied in production: RC425–RC432 and RC434–RC441. Do not apply a partial set or rewrite production migration history.
3. PR [#202](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqaTix/pull/202) and PR [#84](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqaTix/pull/84) contain incompatible versions of migration `20261009200000_rc434_atomic_erp_purchase_receiving.sql`. The collision guard is correct and must not be disabled. PR #202 also had CI failures for missing `scripts/validate-smm-payment-safety.mjs` and `scripts/test-checkout-secret-crypto.mjs`.
4. Live deployed Edge Function entrypoint comparison:
   - `payment-intent` v6, `paymob-webhook` v8, `digital-page-payment-intent` v3, and `subscription-payment-intent` v2 exactly match `main` and PR #202, but not PR #84.
   - `erp-purchase-receive` v1 matches neither PR #202 nor PR #84.
   - `smm-gateway` v6 matches none of the three compared sources.
   - Source equality does not prove runtime correctness.
5. Live `subscription-payment-intent` returns Paymob `clientSecret` directly and does not implement the encrypted recovery path in PR #84. RC439's ciphertext/IV/key-version columns are not present in the live table schema and RC439 is not in the production migration ledger. Table row count was 0 at audit time. Do not deploy half of this contract.
6. Live `smm-gateway` has actionable source-level risks: tenant OWNER/ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN roles can pass the global admin fallback; provider calls have no explicit timeout; provider-response ambiguity may cause an unsafe automatic refund; persistence errors after provider acceptance are not consistently handled; provider-derived status updates lack a terminal-state guard. These are audit findings, not fixes.
7. Supabase Security Advisor reported 94 lints overall (mixed severity): Auth leaked-password protection disabled; anon/authenticated-executable SECURITY DEFINER functions requiring per-function review; `digital_page_payment_events` has RLS enabled but no policies (could be deliberate deny-all); multiple public/anonymous policies need scoped review. No blanket grants/revokes or policies were changed.
8. Comments documenting the findings were posted on PR #202 (including migration conflict/CI, SMM schema/authorization, RC439 recovery, Security Advisor, deployed Edge Function parity, and SMM gateway defects). Comments are evidence of communication only, not code fixes.
9. PR #204's stale Pages deployment cancellation was merged as commit `735f0451bf6dae9ed8cf681f83c4856a4b029041`; it improves release safety but does not resolve the above blockers.

### Work not performed
- No production schema or data mutation.
- No Edge Function deployment.
- No PR #202/#84 merge.
- No claim that the platform is production-ready.
- A previous write attempt to add a missing crypto test script was rejected; the file was **not** added by that attempt.

### Next action — continue from here, do not restart the audit
1. Inspect authoritative history and exact diffs for RC434 in PR #202 versus PR #84; map dependencies across RC425–432 and RC434–441.
2. Select a canonical migration sequence based on actual dependency/behavior evidence, then resolve the branch conflict without disabling the collision guard or rewriting production history.
3. Restore missing CI test scripts only from authoritative existing source/contract; do not create fake tests merely to turn CI green.
4. Replay the full migration sequence in an isolated disposable database and run relevant tests before any production application.
5. Reconcile SMM and payment function source with live behavior and tenant/security contracts; deploy only after tested parity and explicit release gates.
6. Re-run the production gate and record exact run IDs and outcomes.

### Session continuity rules (binding)
- Record every **material project decision, requirement, change, test, blocker, and next action** in `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` in chronological order. Do not log casual greetings; do log any decision that could change implementation.
- After each work batch, update this log and update `docs/PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md` with the latest resume point/status. Update `docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_TODO.md` when gate status or work status changes.
- Every log item must separate **verified fact**, **inference**, **action performed**, **not performed**, and **next step**. Link commits, PRs, CI runs, migrations, and tests when available.
- At the start of every new session, read this continuity file, then the latest entries of the session log and master TODO, then verify current GitHub/Supabase state before modifying anything.
- Never treat an assistant message or a PR comment as proof of implementation. Only code, commit, successful test/runtime evidence, and deployment verification count.
- Do not repeat completed audits unless new evidence or a changed baseline justifies it. Never fabricate evidence or bypass safety/release controls.


## Resume point — 2026-10-12 — exact-head CI checkpoint

- Candidate branch: `reconcile/rc425-458-current-main-20261011`; documentation head is now `058a8ab9f4bf7fbbe3e0d49270688e77d7242124` (the prior exact-head CI evidence is for `95db1770bd89286bfadba9172b0c9409a68e0566`).
- PR #207 remains draft/open/unmerged. The Pages workflow passed validation but skipped deployment. The core module validation and all listed non-SMM boundaries passed at the prior head; SMM Deferred Module Validation failed and remains intentionally untouched under the owner’s freeze.
- Before making further code changes, query Actions for the latest documentation head and record fresh exact-head results. Do not assume prior-head results transfer to the new SHA.
- Highest-priority non-SMM release blockers: ten missing historical SECURITY DEFINER creation dependencies block chronological replay; production ledger reconciles only through RC424; P0 global MantiGO authorization needs validated release fix; tenant/auth/payment/ERP runtime E2E and backup restore/RPO-RTO evidence remain incomplete; leaked-password protection and enforced branch protection remain unresolved.
- Issue #212 is still open: the live SMM gateway has not been proven disabled. UI deferral does not disable the API. Do not deploy or modify the live gateway without explicit approval; keep SMM feature development and its tests frozen.
- No production writes, migrations, function deployments, PR merge, financial mutations, or Auth/RLS/grant changes were made in this session. Release remains **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**.
- The chronological append-only evidence is in `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` (SESSION-002).

## Resume point — 2026-10-12 — Internal marketing campaign workflow

- Candidate branch remains `reconcile/rc425-458-current-main-20261011`, PR #207 draft/open/unmerged.
- Internal Marketing & Advertising workspace now has candidate UI integration for campaign reads, campaign creation, allowed status transitions, partner invitations, and invitation responses using RC453 backend RPCs. The frontend uses business-scope RBAC checks and avoids direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on campaign tables.
- `scripts/validate-marketing-campaign-backend.mjs` now includes workspace/RPC contract assertions and is wired into `.github/workflows/module-professionalization.yml`.
- Last app code commit: `bba4f7ade95ca448cc423beb73726fb670c5081d`. Session log update commit: `3b756de1c7affeef032cb398e5267dc3fc9eccf4`. Fresh exact-head CI has not yet been confirmed for the app change or subsequent documentation commit.
- The RC452/RC453 schema and RPCs remain candidate source only; production migration ledger still reconciles only through RC424. Missing historical SECURITY DEFINER DDL still blocks chronological replay. Do not enable a feature that depends on unapplied schema in production.
- No production migration/deploy, external ad publishing, campaign budget spend, wallet/payment mutation, PR merge, or live Auth/RLS/grant changes were performed.
- SMM storefront/provider-order/wallet implementation remains frozen. This batch only changes the distinct internal Marketing & Advertising workspace.
- Remaining marketing module gaps include lead assignment/status/follow-up workflow, broader verified provider discovery, attribution/analytics tied to real platform data, and authenticated browser E2E after the approved schema release.
- Overall release remains **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**. Continue by querying latest exact-head Actions results, fix only source/test failures that are within the non-SMM launch scope, and keep all production changes behind explicit change approval.


## Resume point — 2026-10-12 — RC425+ remediation

- **Main remains:** `8a56358d505d2c12878440037f7f24ba65d2ea10`. Current work is on `reconcile/rc425-458-current-main-20261011`; latest known docs commit is `9ddc11ab860546c86c0ebadb8a81f38cf707b68b`.
- **Replay gate:** BLOCKED. Run [38195776127](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38195776127) fails closed before Supabase startup because no approved disposable-only `public.bookings` compatibility baseline or authoritative historical DDL is available. Do not add the baseline without explicit owner approval; do not skip or reorder migrations.
- **Dependency analysis:** 12 earlier migrations create 36 tables; hardening migration alters 21; `bookings` is the sole unmatched table dependency in that comparison. Live metadata does not establish historical creation or policy chronology.
- **Targeted CI:** module validation [38195776086](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38195776086), SMM deferred checks [38195776073](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38195776073), SMM service-role ACL [38195776161](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38195776161), migration version uniqueness/history immutability/collision guards all passed on the candidate merge head. Pages validation [38195776024](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38195776024) passed; deploy was skipped.
- **Live SMM:** deployed `smm-gateway` remains ACTIVE v6 and lacks the source-only deny gate from PR #214. Do not expose SMM order/wallet/provider paths at launch until containment is separately authorized, deployed, and negatively tested.
- **No production changes:** no database/migration/Auth/RLS/grant writes, Edge deployments, financial mutations, or merges were performed.
- **Next executable task:** check latest exact-head CI for branch commit `9ddc11ab860546c86c0ebadb8a81f38cf707b68b`; continue searching trusted historical artifacts for bookings creation DDL. If no authoritative source appears, stop at the explicit approval boundary rather than fabricate a fixture.
- **Release status:** **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**.


## Latest verified checkpoint — 2026-10-12 exact-head follow-up

- Candidate head: `65e1830e22768ce9d1b65346c1c8abd35b310d4f`; main remains `8a56358d505d2c12878440037f7f24ba65d2ea10`.
- Exact-head targeted CI passed: module professionalization, backend-only boundary, MantiGO privacy, approval audit atomicity, migration uniqueness/immutability/collision, Marketing Campaign Backend, Marketing CRM tenant scope, SMM service-role boundary, and SMM deferred module validation. See SESSION-004 in `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` for exact run links.
- Pages workflow passed but deployment was skipped because the PR is draft. This is not a production deployment.
- Full migration replay remains blocked at the fail-closed preflight due to missing authoritative historical `public.bookings` creation DDL. Expanded branch/code/commit searches did not recover it.
- Live `smm-gateway` remains active v6 without `MNTY_SMM_ENABLED` / `SMM_POST_LAUNCH_DEFERRED`; candidate PR #214 is not deployed.
- No production mutation, migration, deployment, merge, financial write, or Auth/RLS/grant change occurred.
- **Decision: BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED.** Next action is trusted historical DDL recovery or explicit approval for a disposable-only compatibility baseline; do not fabricate schema or bypass replay.


## SESSION-005 — 2026-10-12 — Current replay checkpoint

- Candidate branch head after the append-only session log update: `31f8202d7e9f6a3ea45c73f576b33d02037dc78e`; code/workflow change: `48bcf340f901e545e547b39639c641c899ea696c`.
- The approved `bookings.sql` compatibility fixture is injected only into the disposable replay as timestamp `20260919233424`, before the hardening migration `20260919233425`. The workflow verifies exact copy, absence of tracked destination, and no row imports.
- Exact-head core and focused CI checks are green; Pages deployment was skipped. Replay run [38239527707](https://github.com/islamnagy2022-eng/MantiqatiX/actions/runs/38239527707) passed preflight and injection checks, but is still starting disposable Supabase services. Full chronological replay is NOT VERIFIED.
- No production changes, merge, live SMM deployment, or release certification occurred. Live SMM gateway v6 remains a P0 containment gate; the SMM feature freeze remains in effect.
- Next: monitor the existing replay run, then respond to its actual result without skipping historical migrations or inventing DDL. Overall status: **BLOCKED / NOT CERTIFIED**.
